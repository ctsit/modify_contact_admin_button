# AUTHORS

The Modify Contact Admin Button module would not be possible without the generous contributions of code, testing, and ideas from the CTS-IT developers, the REDCap Team, and the REDCap Community

We specifically want to thank our developers Tiago Bember tbembersimeao@ufl.edu, Marly Cormar marlycormar@ufl.edu, Dileep Rajput rajputd@ufl.edu, GÃ¼nther Rezniczek guenther.rezniczek@rub.de, and Philip Chase pbc@ufl.edu for their contributions to the project. Taryn Stoffs tls@ufl.edu had the original idea for this module when it was first created as a REDCap hook. She provided valuable input into the design and testing of both the hook and the module.
